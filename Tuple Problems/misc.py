"""
Lets' say we have four tuples and we have four list
Now, we need to write a program where we can have all those elements but in an alterate manner
but the twist is the user would choose the first set of elements

[1,2] [3,4] [5,6] [7, 8, 9]
(11,12) (13,14) (15,16) (17, 18, 19)

1 for list and 2 for tuple 
so, if the user says that i want 1 
then the entry will be 1 2 11 12 3 4 13 14 5 6 15 16 7 8 9 17 18 19
then the entry will be 1 2 11 12 3 4 13 14 5 6 15 16 7 8 9 17 18 19
